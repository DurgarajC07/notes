## 🚀 What Makes These Notes Different

| Traditional Docs  | These Notes                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| "What" it does    | **Why** it exists and **when** to use it  |
| API reference     | **Real-world trade-offs** and constraints |
| Basic examples    | **Production-ready patterns**             |
| Theory-focused    | **Performance & security-driven**         |

## 🎯 Core Principles

✅ **Depth over breadth** - Master fundamentals, then build  
✅ **Trade-offs over absolutes** - Every decision has context  
✅ **Production over theory** - Real-world constraints matter  
✅ **Performance by default** - Measure, optimize, maintain  
✅ **Security-first** - Assume hostile environment  
✅ **Maintainability** - Code is read more than written

## 🎬 Let's Build Better Frontends

These notes represent years of production experience, lessons learned from scaling applications, and patterns that work in real-world scenarios.

**Remember:** The best engineers don't just write code—they understand _why_ it works, _when_ it breaks, and _how_ to make it better.
