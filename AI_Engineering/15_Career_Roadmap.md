## Networking & Community {#networking}

### Why Networking Matters

**Reality:**

- 50% of jobs are filled through referrals
- Networking > Blind applications

**What networking is NOT:**

- ❌ Spamming people on LinkedIn
- ❌ Asking strangers for jobs

**What it IS:**

- ✅ Build genuine relationships
- ✅ Help others (not just ask for help)
- ✅ Engage with content (Twitter, LinkedIn)

---

### How to Network (for introverts)

**1. Build in public:**

- Share progress on X/Twitter ("Built a RAG chatbot today. Here's what I learned...")
- Write blog posts (Medium, personal site)
- Open-source (contribute to LangChain, LlamaIndex)

**Why:** People come to you (not cold outreach)

---

**2. Engage with content:**

- Reply to tweets (from AI researchers, engineers)
- Share posts (with your thoughts, not just retweet)
- Comment on blog posts (thoughtful, not "great post!")

**Why:** Builds visibility (they notice you)

---

**3. Attend meetups (online or in-person):**

- AI/LLM meetups (Meetup.com)
- Conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR too expensive? Try local)

**Why:** Meet people IRL (stronger connections)

---

**4. Informational interviews:**

- Reach out to AI engineers (LinkedIn)
- Ask: "Can I ask 3 questions about your job?" (not "Can you refer me?")
- Be respectful (don't waste their time)

**Why:** Learn about companies, build relationships

---

## Interview Preparation by Level {#interview-prep}

### Junior Level

**Focus:**

- LLM basics (embeddings, tokens, context)
- RAG (how it works, components)
- Prompt engineering
- Your projects (explain deeply)

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks prep

**Mock interviews:** 5-10 (practice explaining projects)

---

### Mid Level

**Focus:**

- System design (RAG, agents)
- Evaluation (RAGAS, LLM-as-judge)
- Cost optimization
- Production experience

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks prep

**Mock interviews:** 10-15 (focus on system design)

---

### Senior Level

**Focus:**

- Complex system design (multi-tenant, large-scale)
- Mentorship stories (STAR format)
- Technical leadership (how you influenced teams)
- Business impact (quantified)

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks prep

**Mock interviews:** 15-20 (get feedback from senior engineers)

---

### Staff Level

**Focus:**

- Strategic thinking (company-wide impact)
- Cross-team leadership (influence without authority)
- Thought leadership (talks, blog posts)
- Long-term vision (3-5 year roadmap)

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks prep

**Mock interviews:** 20+ (with Staff+ engineers if possible)

---

## Common Pitfalls {#common-pitfalls}

### Career Mistakes

**1. Job hopping too early (<1 year)**

**Why it's bad:**

- No depth (just scratched surface)
- Red flag for employers (will you leave us too?)

**When it's OK:**

- Toxic environment
- No learning opportunities
- Company dying

**Better:** Stay 1.5-2 years minimum

---

**2. Only focusing on coding**

**Why it's bad:**

- Senior+ = design, communicate, lead (not just code)

**Fix:**

- Practice system design
- Mentor others
- Write docs, give talks

---

**3. Waiting for promotion**

**Why it's bad:**

- Companies promote when you're already doing next-level work

**Fix:**

- Ask manager: "What do I need for promotion?"
- Start doing that work (6-12 months before asking)
- Track wins (document impact)

---

**4. Not networking**

**Why it's bad:**

- Miss opportunities (jobs filled via referrals)

**Fix:**

- Build in public (Twitter, blog)
- Attend meetups (online or in-person)
- Help others (answer questions, contribute OSS)

---

**5. Chasing titles/salary only**

**Why it's bad:**

- Learning > money (early career)
- Dead-end job with high salary = bad long-term

**Fix:**

- Choose companies with growth potential
- Prioritize learning (good team, mentors)
- Money comes later (senior level)

---

**6. Not building projects**

**Why it's bad:**

- Portfolio = proof you can build
- Interviews ask: "What have you built?"

**Fix:**

- Build 2-3 projects (even if simple)
- Document well (README, demo)
- Deploy (not just localhost)

---

**7. Analysis paralysis**

**Why it's bad:**

- "I need to learn X, Y, Z before I start" → Never start

**Fix:**

- Start building (learn as you go)
- Ship messy v1 (iterate later)
- Done > perfect
