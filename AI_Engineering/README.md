## ⭐ Key Takeaways

1. **AI Engineering ≠ ML Engineering:** Focus on LLMs, agents, and generative systems
2. **Prompting First:** Always try prompt engineering before fine-tuning
3. **RAG is King:** Most production systems use RAG, not fine-tuned models
4. **Evaluation Matters:** Can't improve what you don't measure
5. **Start Simple:** Complex multi-agent systems often fail; start with simple prompts
6. **Cost Awareness:** Track tokens, optimize prompts, cache aggressively
7. **Production is Different:** Latency, reliability, and cost matter more than accuracy
8. **Tools Change:** Frameworks evolve; learn patterns, not just tools
9. **Build Projects:** Theory is worthless without hands-on experience
10. **Interview Ready:** Can you explain your projects clearly? Use STAR method
