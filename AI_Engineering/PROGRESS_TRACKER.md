## 🎯 Next Steps

To complete this knowledge base, you can either:

1. **Request specific sections:** "Create Part 4: Large Language Models"
2. **Request all remaining sections:** "Create all remaining parts (4-15)"
3. **Focus on critical sections:** "Create Parts 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 (most important for interviews and real-world work)"

The remaining sections will add approximately:

- **60,000+ lines of detailed technical content**
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all topics you specified
- **Production-ready knowledge** for AI Engineers at all levels
- **Interview-ready** material with questions and answers

## 📊 Progress Summary

**Completed:** 4/15 major sections + README (~15,000 lines)  
**Remaining:** 11 major sections  
**Estimated total:** ~80,000-100,000 lines of comprehensive notes

**Most Critical for Immediate Use:**

1. Part 6 (RAG) - Most common system in production
